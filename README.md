# DistributedMandelbrot
A 3-in-1 (single-threaded, multi-threaded and MPI distributed) Mandelbrot set renderer written in C++17

Currently it can only be compiled with Visual Studio 2017 RC, 
as it is the only compiler that keeps future C++17 headers already outside of the `experimental` directory.
